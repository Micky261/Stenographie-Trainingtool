# Stenographie Trainingtool

This file explains for whom this tool is and what you can do with it.

There is one important point:
This tool doesn't teach you stenographie, it can only help you to learn fast writing.

The trainingtool is a simple tool, it has online few functions, but it can be very helpful. This tool offers the ability to enter a list of words or/and letters and gives you a list, which contains these elements in a random order. This way you can learn to think and write really fast, especially at the beginning of learning.
